A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function() {
        count++;
        return count;
    };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```
