*August 2021 - Present*

- Lead, developed, and supported machine learning models to forecast KBank ATM incidents using Python and XGBoost. Utilized historical data on ATM incidents and external factors such as hardware logs and customer patterns to train models, achieving an 85% accuracy rate.
- Led the development and support of a PySpark application for analyzing KBank customer statements, leveraging Apache Spark's distributed computing capabilities to handle large volumes of data. Designed and implemented data processing pipelines using PySpark, Hadoop, and ImpalaSQL to extract, transform, and load data from various sources. Collaborated with stakeholders to present insights, identify requirement gaps, and recommend solutions for improving customer experience and increasing revenue.

### Deep Learning Developer (Part-time)
**Self-employed, Nonthaburi, Thailand**  
*August 2022 - January 2023*

- Developed a bone-fracture X-ray image detection model for Chulalongkorn Hospital in collaboration with professors and students (Dev Club) from the Faculty of Computer Engineering and the Faculty of Computer Science at Chulalongkorn University.
- Shared knowledge with students on topics including image segmentation, image classification, and image detection, demonstrating techniques using TensorFlow and PyTorch.

### Tutor/Lecturer (Part-time)
**Self-employed, Bangkok, Thailand**  
*June 2018 - February 2022*

- Taught programming in C/C++, Java, R, and Python, as well as computer science topics including data structures and algorithms, machine learning and deep learning, object-oriented programming, and web development to high school and undergraduate students.
